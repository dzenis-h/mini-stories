A NodeJS app made as a part of a coding test assignment. 

#### First thing is that you need to edit the file *``keys.js* which can be found in the `config` folder. 
#### You would need to make a Google `OAuth` web application credentials., also you would need to set up *MongoDB* URI.

## After that you'll need to run `npm install` inside of the root folder.
## Then you can run `npm start` or `node app.js` and you'll see a beautifully built app.
